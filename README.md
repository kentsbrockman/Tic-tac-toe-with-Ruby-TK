# Tic-Tac-Toe in Ruby

Hello dear devs!

Welcome to the O.G program, a good old classic of the computer science and engineering schools...

Tic-Tac-Toe ðŸ”¥

This program has been entirely made in Ruby (thanks M. obvious!), with a variety of defs pretty much everywhere.

It is also 100% Object-Oriented compliant of course!

## The house specialty: Ruby TK

As part of [The Hacking Project bootcamp](https://www.thehackingproject.org/), we didn't have to implement anything related to visual interface for the exercise. The idea was really to be able to run Tic-Tac-Toe games in the terminal.

But hey, at the end of the day, I just thought "Why not doing something a bit different?"

So, on top of a functional game program, you actually run it with **Ruby TK**, which brought quite a lot of ~~complexity~~ discoveries into the project.

## Setup

To run this program locally, you want to [install the TK library](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html) first.

Then:

1/ Get the resource:
  - Download the repository
  - OR `git clone https://github.com/kentsbrockman/TicTacToe-in-Ruby.git`

2/ Get to the root folder:
  - `$ cd TicTacToe-in-Ruby`

3/ Install the required Ruby gems:
  - `$ bundle install`

4/ Finally, run `ruby app.rb`.
